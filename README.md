Object Value Extractor

This code uses a function to save all object keys and values in a single string. It's like JSON.stringify() except it handles circular structures.

The main way I use this code is to copy and paste the object string to a text editor so I can use the text editor search to find specific values in the object.

Download the JavaScript code file and modify an HTML file to include the JavaScript file with a script tag. Open the HTML file in a browser and check the browser console to see output. Edit the code to go through the test cases and get a feel for how the code works.
